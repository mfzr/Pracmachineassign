# Practical Machine Learning

The goal of this project is to predict the manner in which did the exercise (from data source). This is the "classe" variable in the training set. Use any of the other variables to predict with. Create a report describing how model was build, how used cross validation. Use your prediction model to predict 20 different test cases.
